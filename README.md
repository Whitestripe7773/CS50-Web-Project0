Web Programming with Python and JavaScript
CS50 Webdev Course by Harvard on Edx.org

My website contains infos about my hobbies and my skills
The main focus lies on the design

index.html
-> Main page
-> Contains a quote that I like
-> Used dark images with a skyline

aboutme.html
-> Page about my hobbies and a bit about myself
-> Used images that I found interesting

myskills.html
-> Page about the knowledge of the different languages/technologies
-> Used lighter images

awesome50.html 
-> Last page with an image, that shows a motivational quote "Stop wishing start doing."
-> This page was made to thank edx.org and the team behind this free course.
-> At the bottom is a carousel with three images, that rotates every few seconds
-> In addition there are two buttons, one to go to the top of the page and one that leads to the main page (index.html)

Every page has the same navigation, footer and layout in general
The logo was made by myself using the logomaker from thehoth.com
Creating this website was a lot of fun and I learned many new things about how to design a page,
especially because of Bootstrap and Sass
